# **Description**
<ul type="circle">
  <li>This project predicts whether a customer’s credit card application will be approved based on factors such as income, age, employment status, credit history, and financial indicators. The goal is to help financial institutions automate the approval process and reduce risk using machine learning techniques.</li>
  
# **Technologies Used**
<ul type="circle">
  <li>Data Preprocessing

<li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

<li>Logistic Regression

<li>Random Forest Classifier

<li>Decision Tree Classifier

<li>Train-Test Split

<li>Model Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)</li>

# **Results**
  <li>The Logistic Regression model achieved X% accuracy, Random Forest achieved Y% accuracy, and Decision Tree achieved Z% accuracy.
(Random Forest typically performs best for such classification tasks — update values with your actual results.)</li>
